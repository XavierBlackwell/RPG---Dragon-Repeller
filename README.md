### JavaScript RPG Game

This project is a simple Role Playing Game (RPG) built using JavaScript. The game is designed to help you learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by implementing a text-based RPG. You'll explore key topics like arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, and control flow.

**Features**

Dynamic Interactions: Engage with the game world by making choices that affect your character's stats and progress.
Inventory System: Manage your inventory as you acquire new weapons and items.
Combat Mechanics: Battle monsters, manage your health, and upgrade your weapons to survive in the game world.
Gold Management: Earn and spend gold to purchase upgrades and improve your character's abilities.

**Learning Objectives**

Arrays and Objects: Managing game data such as player stats, inventory, and available weapons.
Functions: Creating reusable blocks of code to handle game logic and interactions.
Control Flow: Using if/else statements and loops to drive the game's decision-making process.
DOM Manipulation: Updating the game interface dynamically based on player actions and game state.
Getting Started
To get started with the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game will load, and you can begin interacting with the game interface.

**Prerequisites**
